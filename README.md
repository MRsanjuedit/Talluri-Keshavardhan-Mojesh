#WEATHER APPLICATION
This weather app allows users to input a city name, fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and displays the relevant information on the webpage. The design is kept simple and user-friendly, with a background image and a clean layout. The use of asynchronous JavaScript ensures smooth interaction, and error handling is implemented to provide feedback in case of issues with the API or city input. The styling enhances the visual appeal of the application.
